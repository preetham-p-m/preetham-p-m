👋 Hello! I'm Preetham P M, a passionate .NET and React developer with experience in GitHub Actions, Docker, TypeScript, and MySQL. I also have a solid understanding of Java and Python.

💻 I specialize in building robust and scalable web applications using the latest technologies and industry best practices. With a meticulous approach to code architecture, I prioritize clean, modular, and maintainable solutions that contribute to seamless backend systems and intuitive frontend interfaces.

🚀 Drawing on my experience, I have successfully tackled complex problems and crafted innovative solutions using .NET, React, and TypeScript. I leverage the power of GitHub Actions and Docker to streamline development processes, implementing seamless integration, automated testing, and efficient continuous deployment pipelines.

🌐 Additionally, I have hands-on experience with microfrontends and module federation, enabling me to create scalable and extensible architectures. By utilizing these techniques, I can build modular and independent frontend components that can be developed and deployed independently, promoting code reusability and efficient team collaboration.

🌱 I have a strong passion for learning and staying updated with the ever-evolving technology landscape. This allows me to adapt quickly to new challenges and remain at the forefront of industry trends. Beyond my proficiency in .NET, React, TypeScript, GitHub Actions, Docker, MySQL, Java, and Python, my expertise in microfrontends and module federation further enhances my ability to design and develop cutting-edge web applications.

💼 I have gained valuable experience working on various projects, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality solutions that meet client expectations.
